  <h2>Dungeon Crawler</h2>
  <p>This was one of the first major projects I decided to try tackling and was one of the first exciting challenges that got me into coding. In high school, I decided that I wanted to learn how to use the Unity 3D engine in other to create 3D projects such as games. After spending some time getting familiar with the platform I took a deep dive into it by trying to make a game from the ground up and seeing where I could go with it. Dungeon crawler is the culmination of all my hard work and understanding of unity. It consists of a menu screen, a character creator, and a single level where you can walk around and encounter enemies. I addition to Unity I also learned a lot of design techniques by working on this project. I got experience creating intuitive and pleasant to look at UIs, and designing 3D worlds. This project continues to be a hobby that I put a few hours into every once in a while when I have time.</p>
