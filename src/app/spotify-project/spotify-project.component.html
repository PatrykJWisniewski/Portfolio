    <h2>SPOTIFY SAFE PLAYLISTS</h2>
    <p>My first significant project at CU Boulder was in a data structures class where we were tasked to use the data structures we learned in class in a project of our choosing. Around this time I had learned that Spotify has a very powerful and free-to-use API. I decided that learning how APIs work and how to use them was something I wanted to accomplish with this final project. I ended up making this an exercise in using binary search trees and hash tables. The project works by first using the API to grab all of a user’s saved songs. After it has all the songs it will either organize by individual songs or by artists depending on the user’s input. If organizing my artists, I used a hash table to group all the songs by artists with each bucket being the artist’s name. After that, I used a BST to sort the songs or artists by popularity. Once that was done I used the API to create a playlist in the user’s account and added all the songs that were above a certain threshold of popularity to that playlist. I had a lot of fun working on this project and learned a lot about how APIs work. </p>
