    <h2>Broccoli's Journey</h2>
    <p>This project was my semester-long group project for my software development class. We were expected to come up with an idea early on in the semester and then work through the entire semester until we reached a finished product. My group decided that they wanted to make a 2D game. Since I already had experience with Unity I suggested we could use it to make the game and that is what we ended up doing. I started this project by creating a basic skeleton project in the engine that would give everyone a foundation to start working on. After that, I worked with my group to teach them about unity and answer any questions that arose while they were getting familiar with the engine. At the same time, we were figuring out how to use firebase to keep track of high scores, and then displaying them on a website we were developing to host our game. We did not manage to finish up everything we wanted to by the end of the semester but still managed to get a lot done with plenty of working features. It was great getting exposure working on something that had multiple layers to manage and understand.</p>
